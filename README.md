==============

This project grew out of the combination of 3 things I'm interested in: Visualizing/leveraging data, long-term health, and the NFL.

To run project locally, clone repo, cd into repo, run makefile, then run node server.js.

This project is by no means finished so any feedback, criticism (constructive or otherwise), or ideas are welcome.
